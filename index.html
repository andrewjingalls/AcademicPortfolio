            <p>Hi! My name is Andrew Ingalls and I'm a recent graduate from Chapman University. I earned a Bachelors in Business Administration and a minor in
                Computer Science. I previously took a Web Engineering class in which we learned 
                how to make websites and deploy them!

                    The specifications for this project were to design and 3D print anything we wanted. Essentially there were
                    no specifications other than we had do model and print everything ourselves. I always loved
                    the idea of a way to open my blinds in the morning without having to get out of bed. 
                    Instead of wasting money on some device that does exactly that, I spent countless hours designing and printing a device 
                    that (sort of) does that. I already had a small arduino controller and stepper motor that was controllable by an inferred remote. 
                    From then, I designed a track system with a gear that attached to the motor, and with the help of plenty of duct tape, stuck to the 
                    curtain rod and the wall. With the press of a button on the remote, the motor would turn the gear and in turn push and pull the curtain open and close. 
                    Admittedly, it turned out to be pretty anticlimactic as the curtain did not open very much, but the project still 
                    was a ton of fun to work on and a great learning experience. I became proficient in using my Prusa 3D printer, AutoDesk Fusion 360, and used my previous C++ knowledge 
                    to program the arduino and control the motor.

                <p>For this project, I delved into the realm of sports analytics by focusing on NBA player data 
                    spanning the last two decades. With an aim to uncover insights and predict player performance, I 
                    employed machine learning models as the cornerstone of my analysis. This endeavor involved 
                    meticulously gathering and preprocessing vast datasets, encompassing player statistics, game
                     outcomes, and various other relevant metrics. Leveraging sophisticated machine learning algorithms,
                      I embarked on the task of constructing predictive models capable of discerning patterns and trends
                       within the data. By training these models on historical player data, I aimed to forecast future
                        player performances with a high degree of accuracy. This project not only enabled me to deepen my 
                        understanding of both sports analytics and machine learning methodologies but also presented an 
                        exciting opportunity to explore the intersection of data science and sports.</p>

                        For this in depth project, I created a simulation of the classic game Super Mario! The simulation included a 5x5 grid which contained mushrooms, 
                        Goombas, Koopas, Coins, a level Boss, and Mario depicted by a "H" for Hero. The simulation was created using C++ and was designed for Mario to 
                        randomly move around the grid and interact with the other objects. If Mario encountered a mushroom, his power level would increase and if he got 
                        a high enough power level, would increase a life. If Mario encountered a Goomba, Koopa, or level boss, there was an algorithm that would determine if 
                        Mario would win or lose the fight. Mario also had to ability to pick up coins and even could find Warp Pipes to skip levels. The goal was to 
                        make it through both levels and defeat the final boss. This project was a great way to learn about 2D arrays, pointers, and gain a deeper understanding into object oriented programming.
